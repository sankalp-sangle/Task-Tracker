# Task-Tracker
Basic task tracker to keep myself organised. Will build on it incrementally as and when I find time.

main.py contains infinite loop to process user commands.
core.py has the essential components (Parser, Task Manager, Tasks).
data.json stores the tasks in json format.

To run:
$python3 main.py
